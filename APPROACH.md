# Approach to Building the FTP Download and XML Processing Script

---

## 1. Setting Up the Environment
- Define FTP server details and local directory paths.
- Ensure necessary local directories (`Temp`, `Local`, `Trash`) exist.

## 2. Downloading Files from FTP Server
- Create a function to connect to the FTP server, list files, and download any new files to a temporary folder.
- The function will run in an infinite loop with a sleep interval to periodically check for new files.

**Function:**
- `download_files()`

## 3. Processing XML Files
- Create a function to process the XML files.
- Extract namespace, measurement types (`measType`), and measurement values (`measValue`).
- Map the values to their corresponding measurement types and store them in a dictionary.
- Move the processed files to the trash folder.

**Function:**
- `process_file(file_path)`

## 4. Monitoring Local Folder for New Files
- Use the `watchdog` library to monitor the local folder for new files.
- Create an event handler that triggers the `process_file` function when a new file is detected.

**Classes and Functions:**
- `MyHandler(FileSystemEventHandler)`
- `monitor_local_folder()`

## 5. Starting the Download and Monitoring Processes
- Use threading to run the FTP download function and the folder monitoring function concurrently.

**Main Execution:**
- Thread for `download_files`
- Start `monitor_local_folder()`

### Summary

1. **Set Up Environment**: Define FTP details and create necessary directories.
2. **Download Files**: Implement function to download new files from FTP server.
3. **Process XML Files**: Parse and process XML files, then move to trash folder.
4. **Monitor Local Folder**: Use `watchdog` to detect new files in the local folder.
5. **Concurrent Execution**: Use threading to run download and monitoring functions concurrently.

This approach ensures that new files from the FTP server are downloaded, processed, and the results are handled appropriately, with robust error handling and monitoring.
